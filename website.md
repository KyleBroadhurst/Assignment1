<h1>Personal information: </h1>
<p>My name is Kyle and im a 22 year old born in Sydney and raised in Bendigo, currently living in Geelong I spend most of my days working at the local Kebab shop and going out with friends. I am a big fan of Korean cuisine with Patbingsu being my favourite dish to have with friends. To this day my highest education has been Year 12, I did briefly partake in an accounting course but I dropped it because it conflicted with my job. Currently I can only speak English but I hope to one day learn either Chinese or Korean. My  dream is to play Dota 2 professionally, I have  flown interstate to compete in events and it has been lots of fun. </p>
<h2>Interest in IT:  </h2>
<p> For me I find the most fascinating part of IT is how it became so integrated in our lives, from TV's to pocket super computers its so interesting seeing how our society brought this technology from and centre into our lives.My interest in IT started from a very young age, when I was around 12 I got sick and couldn't run around anymore so my parents bought me laptop to make sure I wasn't bored, from that moment I was hooked, being able to explore anything, see anything, learning about anything, Ive been hooked on technology ever since.
I chose to come to RMIT because they were the best provider for the course I wanted to do, between the results, the facilities and the good reviews I was convinced this was the university for me. RMIT also have a very large selection of clubs which is very important to me and was the final deciding factor for enrolment.

From this course I hope to learn how to code confidently in Java, C# and HTLM. I hope to fully understand the modern concepts of IT and their impact on my life and the workplace. I hope to be able to know how to get a job successfully and build work experience in my time here. Lastly I hope to be able to understand all the software that goes into making the world of IT run.

 <h2> Ideal Job: </h2>
 <img src="https://imgur.com/rDG6WvA" alt="Snapshot"
 <p>This position is a game developer job located in Singapore, the position is primary revolved around making arcade games for business' like Timezone.  This job is appealing to me because it is unique in the way you not only develop the game, but you also design the controller for the games, such as a gun for a shooting game or perhaps a moving chair for a racing game, the developer gets to control the entire feel of the game and I think that's awesome.
To be able to complete this job I will need a lot of experience in major programming languages such as C#  and C++. I will need a good understanding of common game developer principles such as interfaces and networking. My programming knowledge will need to be more widespread and include things like APIs, website development and Powershell scripts. My understanding of team version control software's like Git will need to be good. I will need to be able to understand how much I can push the available hardware and finally I will need to have a relevant degree or diploma in an IT field.
My current experiences are rather lacking. I have some beginner knowledge of C#, I have a foundation of game developer principles but lack the ability to put them into code currently. I have a  beginners understanding of Java, HTML, C# . I have a more confident understanding on GITHUB and currently no qualifications although I do have some experience building platformer's in Unity.
To obtain the skills I need I will be diligent in my studying in this course, in parallel in this course I will be following various online tutorials covering different programming languages, APIs, Powershell scripts. I will be undertaking work experience in the hopes of furthering my understandings on these concepts as well as how they are implemented practically into real work. Finally I will be working on my project the entire time as I expand on these skills to push my understanding further.

 <p>These test results show I am very fluid in my understanding of things, ready for new information to change my views  but also ready analyse information given myself.  My learning style is predominately tactile, this means I am a very hands on learner and learn best by doing, this is something iv'e known about myself for a while and its good to have a test to back up my hunch. The tests also reflect my constant drive for improvement and my aversion to conflict.
These tests may influence my behaviour in a team in such a way that i'm now aware of my strengths and weakness'. I know i'm not the best person to take a leadership role because of the fluidness of my thinking, I know to work closely with my workmates and to try and come up with lots of ideas, but also listen to theirs and let them change my mind if needed. My high Neuroticism score means I am more likely to be negatively affected by shortcomings in the work.
When forming a team I need to make sure my role fits my personality for maximum efficiency, it means I need to make it clear that I would like to take a middle ground approach to the task and be as flexible as possible. It is up to me to put myself in this situation to ensure i'm doing the most I can towards to task at hand. To avoid negative emotions I must remain away from conflict and perhaps seek validation when needed.

 <h2> Project idea: </h2>
 <p>My project will be an ai management game developed in Unity, the basis of the game is you are the developer of your own mmo, you must build zones for your ai to use and level up on. There will be lots of different things such as a completely ai run market, bosses, training zones, skills all which are completely custom to you as the developer, these will be  events as well as a currency system for the ai  and a money system will be used to provide the player with a sense of progression and take away the sandbox feel of the game.
This project will be interesting because it will be the first game of its kind,  there are games which are somewhat similar like tycoon games but they are focused on the player, while in my game you are focused on helping ai achieve higher stats and world building. I believe these is a market for this sort of game, bringing a mixed interest from a dying strategy game crowd and the simulation crowd.

The game will feature you the player as a game developer, making your first MMO. The goal of the developer is to make money and keep the ai players happy. To do this the developer will need to balance their spending and make decisions on which type of building to make to match the ais needs.
The AI are the bread and butter of this game, they will spawn periodically into the world and seek out tasks to do. Mimicking the players in an MMO game, the AI will not only have their stats which affect things like chance to complete a boss but also preferences, which will further dictate their desire to keep playing and add weighting towards certain decisions. The AI will also be able to earn and equip gear and sell excess gear for money they will put towards things like food.
Structures are there to fill needs and are the link that lets the developer interact with the ai. The developer will be able to build mob zones, quest areas, boss zones, skill zones are banks. There will be city bonuses where you can provide buffs to the AI. This is designed to be the most custom aspect of the game, you can choose how much xp being in the mobzone gives,  the rewards for successfully completing bosses, the rewards for quests just to name a few.
Money is here to tie a sense of progression into the game, the max amount of AI's and the buildings you can place will be tied to this. It will go up overtime depending on how many AI's you currently have to replicate a subscription model, and also go up depending on events.
Events are designed to keep the game feeling fresh and to keep the attention of the developer, they will be decision chains randomly popping up where the developer much choose from a list of options dictating outcomes, these will range from negative to positive and will have a weighting system attached to them deciding their chance of happening.

The market will be the most ambitious part of the game and will attempt to serve as a real time gear market for the AI, The AI will dump old gear onto the market for money and it will only be sold if another AI tries to buy it, prices will fluctuate based on a supply and demand system.

Guilds will allow the AI to form into groups, the main idea behind this is actually  to fulfil the needs of the AI as imagining them as real people, being in the guild will give bonuses to their desire to play the game and form a basis for the AI to complete the group boss buildings.

I will need UNITY to code this game, GiTHUB for version control and 3DMAX to build the models. I will need to use STEAM to publish my game, AWS to host a website about the game and finally sony vegas to make an advertisement for the steam store.
I will need a  very good understanding of C# and java to code this game, I will need to work on my animation and model building skills in 3DMAX. My HTML will need to be adequate for the website and my video editing skills will need some polish. It is very easy to find the skills required, it will just be a matter of putting in the work reading online and following tutorials.
If this project is successful I will have  developed a product I can be proud of any people all over the globe will be able to enjoy. The main takeaway though will be the skills I have developed along the way and the feeling of knowing I have been able to follow my passion in life successfully and develop something special to me.
